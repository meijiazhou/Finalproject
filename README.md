# Finalproject

This is the final project of EPID 600 Data Science for Bioinformatics.

The project uses National Health Interview Survey 2014 to analyze the association between health behavior factors and use of Internet to obtain health information.

The analysis is conducted using R. This repository includes 1) a rmd file with description of the project and commented codes to conduct the analysis; and 2) a subset of the 2014 NHIS sample adult data and person data that was used for the analysis.
